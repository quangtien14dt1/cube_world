# OpenGL

A sample CMake for OpenGL based projects.

### Build instructions

1. Make sure that CMake is installed and added to the system PATH variable.
2. Open terminal in the CMakeLists.txt directory and run:

this only develop on linux (ubuntu) please install sfml, opengl , glew


## Building on Ubuntu

* The following recipe was successfully tested on [Ubuntu 20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) platform.
* So far, we haven't tested [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS), nor any other Unix flavors.
* However, we anticipate most Linux distros should build similarly, aside from a few package-management tweaks.
* So... if you're developing on those platforms, please feel free to contribute :-)

### Prerequisites

```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake mesa-common-dev mesa-utils freeglut3-dev
```
